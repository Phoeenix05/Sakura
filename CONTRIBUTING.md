# Contributing guidelines
None really just keep the code easy to read and follow the folder / project structure. If you want to contribute just fork the repository make your changes and create a pull request. If there are things I would like to change in that pull request then I'll change them and merge the PR.

## Extra
You can add your own profile picture to the project's README
by adding the following to the [contributors](https://github.com/Phoeenix05/sakura#contributors) section of the README.

Change username to match your username.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/username">
    <img src="https://github.com/username.png" alt="Alt Text" width="64" height="64" style="border-radius: .2rem;">
</a>
```
